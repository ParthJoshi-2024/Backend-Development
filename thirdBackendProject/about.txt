Hey, welcome to the third backend project.
In this project we learn about how to do the data modelling.
Here we learn only about the data modelling, not connect with the database.
Using mongoose for the data modelling.
Notes- 
    1. It is a best practise to define all the todos in a separate directory.
    2. The naming way for the models is - modelName.models.js
    3. The models will only be created when we export them.
    4. Basic syntax to create any model using the mongoose is - 
        import mongoose from "mongoose"
        const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({define the object schema here}, {timestamps:true})
        export const user = mongoose.model("modelName", userSchema)
    5. In the syntax the timestamps is used to get the track of the created date and updated date both.
    6. The object in the schema will be created as per the requirement, we can add/remove the properties there.
    7. If we want to take the type of any schema's object from any other model then we use the below syntax - 
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
        ref: "modelName"
